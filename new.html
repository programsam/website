			<p>Ben Smith is an Emerging Technology Institute Solutions Developer working on cloud solutions at IBM's Research Triangle Park location in North Carolina.  He is a recipient of the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/university/phdfellowship/index.shtml">IBM PhD Fellowship</a> for 2010 and 2011. He received his Bachelor's in Computer Science in May of 2007, and received his Master's of Science in Computer Science in May of 2009.  He defended his dissertation, "<a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.16/7943">Empirically Developing a Software Security Test Pattern Catalog Using a Grounded Theory Approach</a>," and received his Doctorate in Computer Science in July of 2012, advised by <a href="http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/" >Dr. Laurie Williams</a>. </p>
			<p>Since joining IBM in August of 2012, Ben has integrated <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/appserv-was-liberty-core/">WebSphere Liberty</a>, IBM's Premiere Web Application platform, into <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a>.  Cloud Foundry has a guest <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/09/09/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack-contributed-to-cloud-foundry/">blog entry</a> featuring Ben's work.  Ben has also been an <a href="https://github.com/programsam">active contributor</a> to the Cloud Foundry open source community, through pull requests and issue reports on Cloud Foundry's repositories on GitHub.  Ben was instrumental in standing up the original version of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-bluemix-dbarnes/">Bluemix</a>, IBM's Platform as a Service that is based on Cloud Foundry.  Ben continues to help integrate WebSphere Liberty and other IBM products integrate their solutions into this new Cloud.  Further, Ben has worked with several IBM clients to stand up their own on-premise instances of IBM's BlueMix, including IBM's cloud services and the <a href="http://github.com/cloudfoundry/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack">Websphere Liberty Buildpack</a>.</p>
			<p>During his time as a PhD student, Ben coauthored a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DzrVikkVLfkC&amp;lpg=PA425&amp;ots=zCOX56sbuH&amp;dq=info%3A-ZjTnKddotkJ%3Ascholar.google.com&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA425#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">book chapter</a> on <a href="http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php">iTrust</a>, a medical records application used in educating students at Noth Carolina State.  Ben also coauthored a paper that has been accepted to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2377656.2377661">Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</a> on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bensmith/website/papers/tosem_metrics.pdf">validation criteria for software metrics</a>. Ben has conducted several <a href="http://bensmith.s3.amazonaws.com/website/papers/icst2011.pdf">empirical studies</a> on software security.  He also worked as a Testing Manager for the <a href="http://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/sdc/students/information/about.php">NCSU CSC Senior Design Center</a>, North Carolina State's capstone course for CSC. He has also written an open source plugin, <a href="http://muclipse.sourceforge.net/">MuClipse</a> which incorporates mutation testing into the popular IDE <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>. He has published an extended work on an empirical user study with Mutation Analysis tools to the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2009.06.031">Journal of Systems and Software</a>. Additionally, he designed and created the website for <a href="http://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/conferences/esem/">ESEM 2009</a>, and written and collaborated several <a href="http://realsearchgroup.com/SEMaterials/tutorials/">tutorials</a> for open source and proprietary software development tools.</p>
		
		<h3 class="sub-header">Extracurricular</h3>
			<p>Ben also offers his expertise in data collection and analysis to medical researchers.  He participated in a <a href="http://bensmith.s3.amazonaws.com/website/papers/jcsm2011.pdf">collaborative research project</a> that analyzed the prevalence of sleep apnea in truck drivers.  He has also participated in <a href="http://bensmith.s3.amazonaws.com/website/papers/sleep2011.pdf">another project</a> that examined the sleep patterns of undergraduate students in a sleeping and wellness course at a major public university.</p>
			<p>Ben also enjoys playing jazz piano and has participated in many bands over the years, including the NC State Jazz Combo (2003-2011) and NC State Jazz Big Bands (I, II and III, 2003-2005).  The NC State Jazz Combo has provided background music for many events, such as the Park Scholar's dinner, and NC State's visit by <a href="http://news.ncsu.edu/features/the-way-forwar/">President Clinton</a>.  He was the primary musician for the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/raleigh/exe.htm">Executive Mansion</a> in North Carolina, providing the right atmosphere for many of the governor's privately-hosted events. He used to play many North Carolina State University events, including the Park Scholar's dinner, the Hood award dinner, the Founder's Day Dinner, the Menscer Cup, and the NC State Athletic Convention.  Whereas software development acts as Ben's scientific, mathematical foundation, music offers him a chance to be creative, social and collaborative.</p>
